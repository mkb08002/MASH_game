# MASH_game

children's game M*A*S\*H

# start out by writing M A S H on the screen

# input list of items (2 ideal 1 not ideal) for

# 1) Where you want to live

# 2) How many kids you want to have

# 3) What is your job

# not ideal item to be randomized

# option for 2 player or computer selected for player 2

# Player 2 then begins to draw a swirl on a separate piece of paper. Player 1 says "Stop" at a time they choose after waiting at least 3 seconds, and player 2 stops and draws a line through the swirl from the endpoint to the starting point. They then count how many times the swirl intercepts the line drawn.

# Alternatively, player 2 will make tally marks instead of drawing a swirl. When player 1 says 'Stop', player 2 stops drawing marks and counts them.

# Player 1 or 2 counts each item down the page (starting with the MASH), and crosses off the answer that they land on. For instance, if four lines were counted in the swirl, every fourth answer is crossed off the list. This continues until there is only one item in each category. Each letter in the title is considered an answer and should be crossed off accordingly.

# The remaining items are considered to determine the Player 1's future while the crossed out ones will be player 2 s future.
