Computer begins to draw a tally marks/swirl on a separate piece of paper. Player 1 says "Stop" at a time they choose after waiting at least 3 seconds, and computer stops and draws a line through the swirl from the endpoint to the starting point. They then count how many times the swirl intercepts the line drawn.

Computer counts each item down the page (starting with the MASH), and crosses off the answer that they land on. For instance, if four lines were counted in the swirl, every fourth answer is crossed off the list. This continues until there is only one item in each category. Each letter in the title is considered an answer and should be crossed off accordingly.

The remaining items are considered to determine the Player 1's future.
